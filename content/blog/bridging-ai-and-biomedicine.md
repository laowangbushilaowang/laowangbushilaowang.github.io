Interdisciplinary AI work often fails at the interface between disciplines, not at the model architecture.

## Three Design Principles

### 1. Optimize for interpretation, not only accuracy
A slightly weaker model that exposes meaningful structure is often more useful in scientific settings.

### 2. Design data handling as part of the model
In biological data, preprocessing choices can dominate performance. Pipeline design is part of method design.

### 3. Build communication loops
Frequent feedback from domain experts is essential. Their questions can expose failure modes that metrics miss.

## Why This Matters

Academic AI should reduce uncertainty for domain experts. For me, this means building systems that are measurable, inspectable, and easy to extend.
